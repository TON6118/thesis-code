This repository contains the codebase developed for my thesis project.

**Please Note**
Environment-Specific: The code is not fully portable. Variable names, file paths, and configurations are tailored to the setup used during development.

**Legacy Version:** This version reflects the project as it existed in February 2025. As of April 2025, it may not run as-is due to changes in dependencies or system configuration.

**Work in Progress:** While this is a functional implementation, there is still room for improvement in code structure, clarity, and documentation. Some areas may be sparsely commented.
